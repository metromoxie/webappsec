# Introduction # {#intro}

<em>This section is not normative.</em>

Currently, web applications are almost always compartmentalized by using
separate host names to establish separate web origins. This is useful for
helping to prevent XSS and other cross-origin attacks, but has many unintended
consequences. For example, it causes latency due to additional DNS lookups,
removes the ability to use single-origin features (such as the
history.pushState API), and creates cryptic host name changes in the user
experience. Perhaps most importantly, it results in an extremely inflexible
architecture that, once rolled out, cannot be easily and transparently changed
later on.

There are several mechanisms for reducing the attack surface for XSS without
creating separate host-name based origins, but each pose their own problems.
Per-page Suborigins is an attempt to fill some of those gaps. Two of the most
notable mechanisms are Sandboxed Frames and Content Security Policy (CSP). Both
are powerful but have shortcomings and there are many external developers
building legacy applications that find they cannot use those tools.

Sandboxed frames can be used to completely separate untrusted content, but they
pose a large problem for containing trusted but potentially buggy code because
it is very difficult, by design, for them to communicate with other frames. The
synthetic origins assigned in a sandboxed frame are random and unpredictable,
making the use of postMessage and CORS difficult. Moreover, because they are by
definition unique origins, with no relationship to the original origin,
designing permissions for them to access resources of the original origin would
be difficult.

Content Security Policy is also promising but is generally incompatible with
current website design. Many notable companies found it impractical to retrofit
most of their applications with it. On top of this, until all applications
hosted within a single origin are simultaneously put behind CSP, the mechanism
offers limited incremental benefits, which is especially problematic for
companies with large portfolios of disparate products all under the same domain.

## Goals ## {#goals}

<ol>
  <li>
    Provide a way for different applications hosted at the same real origin to
    separate their content into separate logical origins. For example,
    https://foobar.com/application and https://foobar.com/widget, today, are, by
    definition, in the same origin, even if they're different applications. Thus
    an XSS at https://foobar.com/application means an XSS at
    https://foobar.com/widget, even if https://foobar.com/widget is "protected"
    by a strong Content Security Policy.
  </li>

  <li>
    Similarly, provide a way for content authors to split their applications
    into logical modules with origin level separation without using different
    real origins. Content authors should not have to choose between putting all
    of their content in the same origin, on different real origins, or putting
    content in anonymous unique origins (sandboxes).
  </li>

  <li>
    Provide a way for content authors to attribute different permissions such as
    cookie access, storage access, etc. to different suborigins.
  </li>

</ol>

Issue: Not sure how to actually refer to 'real origins'. This is a terrible
name, and we need a better way to talk about them. Maybe physical origin?
Traditional origin? (jww)

## Use Cases/Examples ## {#usecases}

We see effectively three different use cases for Per-page Suborigins:

<ol>
  <li>
    Separating distinct applications that happen to be served from the same
    domain, but do not need to extensively interact with other content. Examples
    include marketing campaigns, simple search UIs, and so on. This use requires
    very little engineering effort and faces very few constraints; the
    applications may use XMLHttpRequest and postMessage to communicate with
    their host domain as required.
  </li>

  <li>
    Allowing for modularity within a larger web application by splitting the
    functional components into different suborigins. For example, Gmail might
    put the contacts widget, settings tab, and HTML message views in separate
    Per-page Suborigins. Such deployments may require relatively modest
    refactorings to switch to postMessage and CORS where direct DOM access and
    same-origin XMLHttpRequest are currently used, but we believe doing so is
    considerably easier than retrofitting CSP onto arbitrary code bases and can
    be done very incrementally.
  </li>

  <li>
    Similar to (2), applications with many users can split information relating
    to different users into their own suborigin. For example, Twitter might put
    each user profile into a unique suborigin so that an XSS within one profile
    cannot be used to immediately infect other users or read their personal
    messages stored within the account.
  </li>

</ol>

# Defining a Suborigin # {#defining-suborigin}

Origins are a mechanism for user agents to group URIs into protection domains.
Two URIs are in the same origin if they share the same scheme, host, and port.
If URIs are in the same origin, then they share the same authority and can
access all of each others resources.

This has been a successful mechanism for privilege separation on the Web.
However, it does limit the ability of a URI to separate itself into a new
protection domain as it automatically shares authority with all other identical
origins, which are defined by physical, rather than programatic, properties.
While it is possible to setup unique domains and ports different parts of the
same application (scheme is more difficult to separate out), there are a diverse
set of practical problems in doing so.

Suborigins provide a mechanism for creating this type of separation
programatically. Any resources may provide, in a manner detailed below, a string
value [suborigin namespace][].  If either of two URIs provide a suborigin
namespace, then the two URIs are in the same origin if and only if they share
the same scheme, host, port, and suborigin namespace.

Q. In today's Web, can't a site get the effective same protection domain simply
by hosting their content at different subdomains?

A. Yes, but there are many practical reasons why this is difficult:

## Difficulties using subdomains

### Separate applications, same origin
Google runs Search and Maps on the same domain, respectively
`https://www.google.com` and `https://www.google.com/maps`. While these two
applications are fundamentally separate, there are many reasons for hosting them
on the same origin, including historical links, branding, and performance.
However, from security perspective, this means that a compromise of one
application is a compromise of the other since the only security boundary in the
browser is the origin, and both applications are hosted on the same origin.
Thus, even if Google Search were to successful implement a strong Content
Security Policy [[CSP2]], if Google Maps were to have an XSS vulnerability, it
would be equivalent to having an XSS on Google Search as well, negating Google
Search's security measures.

### Separation within a single application
Separation is sometimes desirable within a single application because of the
presence of untrusted data. Take, for example, a social networking site with
many different user profiles. Each profile contains lots of untrusted content
created by a single user but it's all hosted on a single origin. In order to
separate untrusted content, the application might want a way to put all profile
information into separate logical origins while all being hosted at the same
physical origin. Furthermore, all content within a profile should be able to
access all other content within the same origin, even if displayed in unique
frames.

This type of privilege separation within an application has been shown to be
valuable and reasonable for applications to do by work such as
Privilege Separation in HTML5 Applications by Akhawe et al
[[PrivilegeSeparation]]. However, these systems rely on cross frame messaging
using `postMessage` even for content in the same trust boundary since they
utilize `sandbox`. This provides much of the motivation for the named container
nature of suborigins.

## Relationship of Suborigins to Origins

Suborigins, in fact, do not provide any new authority to resources. Suborigins
simply provide <em>an additional way to construct Origins</em>. That is,
Suborigins do not supercede Origins or provide any additional authority above
Origins. From the user agent's  perspective, two resources in different
Suborigins are simply in different Origins, and the relationship between the two
resources should be the same as any other two differing origins as described in
[[!RFC6454]].  Thus, this specification is intended to provide the following two
important properties:

* The rules on how Suborigins are defined.
* The rules on how Suborigins are tracked.

## Representation of Suborigins

At an abstract level, a suborigin consists of the scheme, host, and port of a
traditional origin, plus a <a>suborigin namespace</a>. However, as mentioned
above, suborigins are intended to fit within the framework of [[!RFC6454]].
Therefore, this specification provides a way of serializing a Suborigin bound
resource into a traditional Origin. This is done by inserting the suborigin
namespace into the scheme space of the Origin, thus creating a new scheme but
maintaining all of the information about both the original scheme and the
suborigin namespace. This is done by inserting a <code>+</code> into the URI
after the scheme, followed by the suborigin namespace, then followed by the rest
of the URI starting with <code>:</code>.

For example, if the resource is hosted at <code>https://example.com/</code> in
the suborigin namespace <code>profile</code>, this would be serialized as
<code>https+profile://example.com/</code>.

Similarly, if a resource is hosted at <code>https://example.com:8080/</code> in
the suborigin namespace <code>separate</code>, this would be serialized as
<code>https+separate://example.com:8080/</code>.

Internally, the <a>suborigin namespace</a> must be tracked by the user agent. When
the origin needs to be serialized for a resource, the user agent should follow
the algorithm in [[#serializing]].

## Opting into a Suborigin

Unlike the <code>sandbox</code> attribute, suborigin namespaces are predictable
and controllable. Because of this, potentially untrusted content cannot opt into
suborigins, unlike iframe sandboxes. If they could, then an XSS on a site could
enter a specific suborigin and access all of its resources, thus violating the
entire privilege separation suborigins are intended to protect. To prevent this,
the server (rather than a resource itself) is treated as the only authoritative
source of the suborigin namespace of a resource. This is implemented through an
additional header-only Content Security Policy directive <code>suborigin</code>,
which takes a string value that is the namespace. For example, to put a resource
in the `testing` suborigin namespace, the server would specify the following
directive in the CSP header:

<pre>
  suborigin: testing
</pre>

## The <code>suborigin</code> Directive

Suborigins are defined by a <dfn>suborigin directive</dfn> in the Content
Security Policy [[!CSP2]] of the resource. The syntax for the name and value of
the directive are described by the following ABNF grammar:

<pre>
  directive-name  = "suborigin"
  directive-value = 1*( ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" )
</pre>

A resource's <dfn>suborigin namespace</dfn> is the value of the
<code>suborigin</code> directive.

## Accessing the Suborigin in JavaScript

Issue: I don't have a great idea for how to do this yet. Should it be as simple
as document.location.suborigin? Or should it be serialized into document.origin,
plus a deserialization mechanism? (jww)

# Access Control # {#access-control}

Cross-origin (including cross-suborigin) communication is tricky when suborigins
are involved because they need to be backwards compatible with user agents that
do not support suborigins while providing origin-separation for user agents that
do support suborigins. The following discussions discuss the three major
cross-origin mechanisms that are relevant.

## CORS ## {#cors}

For pages in a suborigin namespace, all <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>s to any URL
should be treated as cross-origin, thus triggering CORS [[!CORS]] logic with
special <code>Finer-Origin:</code> and <code>Suborigin:</code> headers added.
Additionally, the <code>Origin:</code> header that is normally applied to
cross-origin requests should <em>not</em> be added. These header changes are
needed so that a server that recognizes suborigins can see the suborigin
namespace the request is coming from and apply the appropriate CORS headers as
is appropriate, while legacy servers will not "accidentally" approve
cross-origin requests because of an <code>Origin</code> header that provides an
incomplete picture of the origin (that is, an origin without the suborigin).

The <code>Finer-Origin:</code> header takes a value identical to the Origin
Header, as defined in [[!RFC6454]]. The <code>Suborigin:</code> header takes a
string value that is the suborigin namespace. The former servers identically as
the <code>Origin:</code> header, but in a purposefully backwards incompatible
way, while the <code>Suborigin:</code> header allows a server to make a more
nuanced access control choice. A user agent must not include more than one
<code>Finer-Origin:</code> header and must not include more than one
<code>Suborigin:</code> field.

Similar changes are needed for response from the server with the addition of
<code>Access-Control-Allow-Finer-Origin</code> and
<code>Access-Control-Allow-Suborigin</code> response headers. The former takes
the same values as <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> as defined in
[[!CORS]], while the later takes a string value that matches allowed suborigin
namespaces, or <code>*</code> to allow all suborigin namespaces.

Issue: I expect that this will be a relatively controversial part of the
proposal, but I think the concern is pretty important. In particular, a lot of
the potential benefits of the proposal are eliminated if the Origin header is
set with the broad, traditional origin as an isolated but compromised suborigin
could just request private information from the other origin. That having been
said, we might be able to bypass a lot of these concerns by using the Origin
header but putting the serialized suborigin as described above it its place.
This would require monkey patching the Origin spec's syntax of the Origin
header.

## <code>postMessage</code> ## {#postmessage}

Cross-origin messaging via <code>postMessage</code> [[!WebMessaging]] provides
many of the same concerns as CORS. Namely, it is necessary for the recipient to
see the suborigin namespace of the message sender so an appropriate access
control decision can be made, and similarly, legacy applications should by
default treat these messages as not coming from the traditional origin of the
sender.

To enforce this, when a message is sent from a suborigin namespace, the receiver
has the <code>event.origin</code> value set to <code>null</code> so if it is
read, it is not treated as coming from any particular origin. Instead, new
propriets of <code>event.finerorigin</code> and <code>event.suborigin</code>
should be set the scheme/host/port and suborigin namespace, respectively.

Issue: Similar to the CORS case, another option is to set
<code>event.origin</code> to the serialized namespace and then provide a
deserialization tool.

### Workers ### {#workers}

Issue: We need a story here. I basically think that workers should be treated as
if they're in the same suborigin as whatever created them, but I'm also open to
other suggestions. Particularly tricky are service workers, which for simplicity
sake I suggest we treat as applying universally to all suborigins at a single
physical origin since it works in terms of network requests, and suborigins are
not relevant to network requests. Pull requests welcome.

# Impact on Web Platform # {#impact}

Content inside a suborigin namespace is severely restricted in what the hosted
content can do. The restrictions match the behavior of an iframe with the
sandbox attribute set to the value of <code>allow-scripts</code> [[!HTML]].
While more specifics are described below, the general idea here is to put
suborigin namespaces in a "default secure" context. However, restrictions may be
lifted going forward at a time when a way to whitelist particular Web platform
permissions is well-defined.

## Relationship with Sensitive Permissions

Issue: We need to discuss DOM storage, cookies, document.domain, etc. In
particular, we should relate this to
http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/browsers.html#sandboxing.

</section><!-- Impact on Web Platform -->

<section>
# Framework ## {#framework}

Note: These sections are tricky because, unlike traditional origins, we can't
define suborigins in terms of URIs. Since the suborigin namespace is defined in
a header, not in the URI, we need to define them in terms of resources.

## Suborigin of a Resource

The suborigin of a resource is the value computed by the following algorithm:

<ol>

  <li>
    Let origin be the triple result from starting with step 1 of Section 4 of
    the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6454#section-4">Section 4</a> of
    of the Origin specification. [[!RFC6454]]
  </li>

  <li>
    If the Content Security Policy of the resource contains a valid
    <a>suborigin directive</a> in the <a
    href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP2/#policy-syntax">directive list</a>
    [[!CSP2]], then let <code>suborigin-namespace</code> be the
    <code>directive-value</code>.
  </li>

  <li>
    Otherwise, let <code>suborigin-namespace</code> be <code>null</code>.
  </li>

  <li>
    Return the pair <code>(origin, suborigin-namespace)</code>.
  </li>

</ol>

## Comparing Suborigins

Issue: Since we'd like to make the claim that suborigins do not supercede the
same-origin policy, would it be worth defining suborigins purely in terms of
being a unique scheme? That would make this section somewhat unnecessary since
origin comparisons would be the same.

Two suborigins are "the same" if, and only if, they are identical. In
particular:

*   If the origin portions of the suborigin pairs are scheme/host/port triples,
    the two suborigins are the same if, and only if, they have identical
    schemes, hosts, and ports and the <code>suborigin-namespace</code> portions
    of the suborigin pairs are identical.
*   If both <code>suborigin-namespace</code> portions of the suborigin pairs are
    null, this is considered identical.
*   An origin that is a globally unique identifier cannot be the same as an
    origin that is a scheme/host/port triple, with or without a
    <code>suborigin-namespace</code>.

Two resources are the same-origin if their suborigins are the same.

## Serializing Suborigins ### {#serializing}

This section defines how to serialize an origin to a unicode [[!Unicode6]]
string and to an ASCII [[!RFC0020]] string.

### Unicode Serialization of a Suborigin

The Unicode serialization of a suborigin is the value returned by the following
algorithm:

<ol>

  <li>
    If the origin portion of the suborigin pair is not a scheme/host/port
    triple, then return the string
      <pre>
        null
      </pre>

    (i.e., the code point sequence U+006E, U+0075, U+006C, U+006C) and abort
    these steps.
  </li>

  <li>
    Otherwise, if the suborigin-namespace portion of the suborigin pair is not
    null:

    <ol>

      <li>
        Let suffix be the string "+".
      </li>

      <li>
        Append the suborigin-namespace portion of the suborigin pair to suffix.
      </li>

      <li>
        Append suffix to the scheme part of the origin triple.
      </li>

    </ol>
  </li>

  <li>
    Proceed with step 1 of <a
    href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6454#section-6.1">Section 6.1 in the
    Origin specification</a> [[!RFC6454]].
  </li>

</ol>

### ASCII Serialization of a Suborigin

The ASCII serialization of a suborigin is the value returned by the following
algorithm:

<ol>
  <li>
    If the origin portion of the suborigin pair is not a scheme/host/port
    triple, then return the string

      <pre>
        null
      </pre>

    (i.e., the code point sequence U+006E, U+0075, U+006C, U+006C) and abort
    these steps.
  </li>

  <li>
    Otherwise, if the suborigin-namespace portion of the suborigin pair is not
    null:

    <ol>

      <li>
        Let suffix be the string "+".
      </li>

      <li>
        Append the suborigin-namespace portion of the suborigin pair to suffix.
      </li>

      <li>
        Append suffix to the scheme part of the origin triple.
      </li>

    </ol>
  </li>

  <li>
    Proceed with step 1 of <a
    href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6454#section-6.2">Section 6.2 in the
    Origin specification</a> [[!RFC6454]].
  </li>

</ol>

# Security Considerations

## Presentation of Suborigins to Users

A complication of suborigins is that while they provide a meaningful security
for an application, that boundary makes much less sense to a user. That is,
traditional origins provide a security boundary at a physical level: separate
scheme, hosts, and ports map to real boundaries external of a given application.
However, suborigins as a boundary only makes sense <em>within the context of the
program logic itself</em>, and there is no meaningful way for users to make
decisions based on suborigins a priori.

Therefore, suborigins should be used only internally in a user agent and should
not be presented to users at all. For example, suborigins should never be
presented in link text or a URL bar.

## Not Overthrowing Same-origin Policy

Suborigins do not fundamentally change how the same-origin policy works. An
application without suborigins should work identially to how it always has, and
even in an application with suborigins, the same-origin policy still applies as
always. In fact, suborigins have been defined within the context of the
same-origin policy so that, in theory, serialized suborigins can be thought of
as a just a special case of the traditional same-origin policy.
